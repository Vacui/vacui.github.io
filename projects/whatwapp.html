								<p>Working on the game <span class="uk-text-bold">Burraco</span>, in Whatwapp, has been my first gamedev-related job, and an invaluable experience to work beside other passionate individuals, that helped me get acquaintanced with the everyday life of a Game Programmer.</p>
								<p>It was a much more server-facing role than I initially expected, but it gave me the opportunity to deeply explore how that branch of videogame programming works, and I now look at games with different eyes.</p>

								<p>In my starting weeks, everything was new and covered by a shiny patina, there was so much to discover every day!<br>
								I started by getting acquainted with the tools the team used to organize and manage the development workflow, which were:</p>
								<dl class="uk-description-list">
									<dt><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: asana; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-text-middle uk-text-bold">Asana</span></dt>
									<dd>New tasks every day, and they are all centralized in this handy software.</dd>
									<dt><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: slack; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-text-middle uk-text-bold">Slack</span></dt>
									<dd>Every time I had to call a colleague for help, contact a broader group of individuals, or note something down for later, I used <span class="uk-text-italic">Slack</span> and the many chats and rooms the company had prepared for every discipline.</dd>
									<dt><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: sourcetree; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-text-middle uk-text-bold">Sourcetree</span></dt>
									<dd>A tool I was already accustomed to thanks to my many personal projects, but I was still surprised by the use of modules.</dd>
									<dt><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: visualstudio-code; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: jetbrains; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-text-middle uk-text-bold">IDE of choice</span></dt>
									<dd>To handle the coding I was free to choose between various software and I settled for <span class="uk-text-italic">Visual Studio Code</span> for the server-side, attracted by its handy terminal, and <span class="uk-text-italic">JetBrains</span> for the client.</dd>
									<dt><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: docker; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-text-middle uk-text-bold">Docker</span></dt>
									<dd>A totally new tool I discovered during my stay at Whatwapp, is used to manage all the local server that simulates the game in various development states.</dd>
									<dt><span class="uk-margin-small-right" uk-icon="icon: google-meet; ratio: 1"></span><span class="uk-text-middle uk-text-bold">Google Meet</span></dt>
									<dd>Hand in hand with <span class="uk-text-italic">Google Calendar</span>, I extensively used it to meet with other colleagues and discuss all sorts of topics.</dd>
								</dl>
								<p>Many of these tools were especially useful during the COVID pandemic period, which forced me to stay home and experience a full-remote workflow, that later on became a hybrid with an in-person mandatory day a week.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>After set upping everything I needed, I was tasked to explore a tool called <span class="uk-text-bold">Beamable</span> so that I could introduce the rest of the team later, during what promised to be a major migration effort of the entire game server infrastructure.</p>
								<p>The migration happened, but unfortunately not with the aforementioned tool, instead, the company decided to use another one, called <span class="uk-text-bold">Nakama</span>, nevertheless, the time spent dissecting the game logic helped me adapt more easily and in a less long timeframe.</p>

							<div>
								<p>An exciting ride that doesn't happen every day, with new challenges around every corner, during which I was lucky to receive the help of numerous developers from the teams of all games, because we were all together in this monumental effort, consisting of understanding, adapting, reshaping, and converting code that had not been seen by human eyes in years.</p>
								<p>As a Junior I was shielded by the Senior and Lead Developers, that took the brunt of the challenge and started developing flexible modules we would later use to code the game features, free from some of their complexities, such as currency transactions or server objects saving and loading.</p>
								<p>Personally, I had my hands full with learning a new coding language in the form of <span class="uk-text-bold">TypeScript</span> and using it to migrate various features, such as the minigames <span class="uk-text-bold">Candyland</span> (a Slot Machine) and <span class="uk-text-bold">Galleon</span> (a Match 3 game), or the club's <span class="uk-text-bold">Chat</span> and <span class="uk-text-bold">Managing</span> (member's promotion, kicking, etc..) systems, I contributed to the friend's <span class="uk-text-bold">Chat</span> and <span class="uk-text-bold">Donations</span> systems as well.<br>
								In many of these cases, I had to refactor slices of code or rethink part of it to fit the uniquenesses of the new infrastructure. This was not limited to the server, but also the client-side needed some tweaking here and there to make everything run smoothly.<p>
								<p>When everything was near completion, we started testing the game to spot any weakness, helped by other members of the team. I cannot remember a testing session ending without finding at least a couple of edge cases to fix the next day.<br>
								Testing so extensively a game was something I had never done before, and it taught me a lot about how stressful can be the process of polishing a game, and I have now more respect for the UX and Testing branch of game development.

							<div>
								<p>This project is where I personally feel I graduated from being just a programmer building small projects and started walking the path of the Game Developer. I learned so much about how games are built, how a team behaves, and the reality of a work environment. It taught me about reaching compromises, something I thought I already learned by myself long ago, but having a strict limit on time and resources really cemented the lesson.</p>
								<p>There are probably a hundred things I could have done differently, I will be satisfied knowing that I have grown up and that tomorrow other challenges awaits me.</p>
