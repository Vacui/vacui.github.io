													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">Ploppem is a minimal endless runner I developed to strengthen my skills and improve my portfolio as a game programmer.<br>
													Initially, it would have included various game modes and a more cartoonish art style, but after encountering several difficulties on the road, I decided to focus my time on polishing what I had already realized, and therefore reducing the project scope.</p>

													<h3 class="uk-margin-small-bottom">Gameplay</h3>
													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">In its current state, the game offers an endless mode against enemies that are guided by a rough AI, that tells them to constantly move and change direction, while also trying to avoid collision with other entities.<br>A gradient-colored clock tells the player their individual lifetime, at the end of which they disappear adding an error to the top-right counter. Reached 5 errors the game is over.<br>
													The player's only interaction is by earning points as a result of touching over an enemy, an action that makes them also disappear.</p>
												</div>
												<div>
													<img class="project-image uk-margin-small-bottom uk-align-right uk-margin-remove-adjacent" data-src="img/projects/ploppem/Screen3.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" uk-img>
													<h3 class="uk-margin-small-bottom">Game systems</h3>
													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">After some testing, I decided to increase the game difficulty using some animated curves that control the speed, lifetime, and other stats of the enemies, based on the player score.<br>
													The spawning process is controlled by the GameManager script, a class that manages almost every vital system, an exception is the User Interface. After an enemy is eliminated by the player, or by running out of time, the GameManager queue another spawn, and when the time comes it makes sure to find a clear spot to generate the new foe, or else enqueuing again the spawn.</p>

													<img class="project-image uk-margin-small-bottom uk-align-left uk-margin-remove-adjacent" data-src="img/projects/ploppem/Screen2.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" uk-img>
													<h3 class="uk-margin-small-bottom">Customization</h3>
													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">To improve the player experience and gain something from the game life I designed a customization system that gives the player the opportunity to change the game background, enemies' gradient palette, and UI's color scheme. In theory, some customizations would be free to use, and some others locked behind a paywall, but I wasn't able to polish the system enough to justify charge people to use it, and I decided to include it in the game completely free to use.</p>
												</div>
												<div>
													<p>In the end, developing Ploppem teach me a lot of things, and even with all the problems it has, I'm proud of the result.<br>
													I hope you will give it a chance and enjoy playing it.</p>

									<p>Nodib is a one-finger action/puzzle game I developed as a side project to take a break from my other game Ploppem.<br>It took me just a couple of weeks to complete it, using various tricks to speed up the process along the way. The lack of big challenges has helped me focus on trying new things, such as the use of social media to reach potential users and gather feedback.</p>

													<h3 class="uk-margin-small-bottom">Gameplay</h3>
													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">The game is not complex and the player experience is divided between 8 levels, and with the exception of the last one, created just for fun, the others offer an increasing difficulty.<br>
													The player is tasked to collect coins scattered on the screen using a small ball. By launching the ball in an <i>Angry Birds style</i>, the player is able to make it bounce on the walls, the movement will not stop until it has returned to its original spot or another "safe" position. To prevent the player to easily accomplish his/her goal I developed enemies that follow a specified pattern, killing the player on touch instantly.</p>

													<img class="project-image uk-margin-small-bottom uk-align-right uk-margin-remove-adjacent" data-src="img/projects/nodib/puzzles.png" width="200" height="200" alt="" uk-img>
													<h3 class="uk-margin-small-bottom">Development</h3>
													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">While I look at Nodib as a temporary break, I still tried to use it to improve my skills by challenging myself on creating a puzzle game, and also its level system. But on top of technical problems I had to overcome, I also addressed a problem that was hurting my other project Ploppem.<br>The lack of feedback.<br>This time I decided to increase my social presence and I started publishing game concepts, pulls, and other messages on Twitter. The reaction has not been noticeable, but I still managed to gather opinions on my work that helped polish the game and avoid some dangerous errors along the way.p>
												</div>
												<div>
													<p>In the end, developing Nodib has reached the desired objective, and I was able to return to Ploppem recharged and with even more ideas than before.<br>A happy ending after all.</p>

									<p>Oath is a single-player hack'n'slash isometric game I produced during my second year on a Game Design course I attended between 2017-2020. It is the result of the combined efforts of more than 20 individuals from all the school departments: Concept Art, Game Programming, Game Design and 3D Modelling<br>The task I had to perform was keeping an eye on all the online platforms the teams were using, and trying to improve their efficency by introducing new methodologies, templates, and settings.</p>

													<h3 class="uk-margin-small-bottom">Production</h3>
													<p class="uk-margin-remove-top">My biggest challenge was learning all the different tools I was assigned to manage.<br>We used Google Drive as central file storage, Sourcetree and GitHub for the game code, but the daily life of every worker revolved around the online task platform named Trello. Define rules to reduce the confusion and find the best way to organize the work, was the biggest problem I had to overcome during the game development.<br>The first solution that I found after various attempts, together with the other departments' chiefs, was complex and hard to use, but as I refined the templates and more people understood the pros of an organized push, the development process becomes more fluid.</p>
												</div>
												<div>
													<p>In the end, helping producing Oath teached me many things about teamwork and how to hear and ask for feedback, so I'm happy to had had that experience.</p>
